# G7
Digitalization of a not very well-known game called G7



In this version there are 2 teams, yellow and red.
The goal is to either capture all the pieces of the enemy or have 1 friendly piece on each of all 4 blue squares around the center, or place a King on the enemy's throne.
There are 3 types of pieces:

-> Kings: Speed, Average, Power: They can capture and be captured by any piece (they can even capture friendly pieces). When they are on their team's throne, every piece receives a boost:
for Speed they receive +2 speed (2 extra squares per move)
for Power they receive +2 power
for Average they receive +1 speed and +1 power
However each king can only stay on the throne for 30 days, aka moves. After that they die.

-> Canons: Each team has 2 canons, they are unique pieces. If you decide to use a canon on your turn you get 2 moves for it, a move can be rotate 90 degrees, move 1 square to the front, shoot. (If i recall correctly each shot has either a 5 square, or infinite range and can kill anything).

-> Pieces: There are 5 kinds of pieces, 1,2,3,4,5. Their names are their power level. A non boosted piece with a power level of X can kill an enemy piece with a power level of X or less by landing on it. Each piece also has a speed level, which is 6-X (aka 6 - its power level), which shows the maximum amount of squares the piece can move at every turn.


How to play: 
To move a piece on your turn bring your cersor over that piece and press a, then bring the cursor over the square you want the piece to land on and press a again, if it is a valid move the piece will move there. 
For canons, bring your cursor over the canon, press a twice and select 3 actions you want the canon to take, then select End. If the moves are valid the canon will perform them.
